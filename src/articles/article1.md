## Python Projects Without Pollution: Why You Need Virtual Envs

As a developer, if you have worked with python and it's extensive ecosystem of packages for performing tasks such as data processing, visualization or for building web applications, you require different packages for doing so.

```bash

```

The culprit could be  Environment pollution, which is one of the most common yet neglected challenges in python development.
